The lecturer claims that none of the three solutions from the text proves practical. 

First, she claimed that restricting the usage of pesticide will actually decrease the crops. Because if strict laws on limiting the usage of pesticide is applied, farmers may switch their jobs and do not grow crops any more. So this method is not fair nor economic.

Secondly, she said it would not be effective to treat all frogs against fungas. Because there is a wide varity of kinds of frogs, and each species may have certain kinds of fungas threathening their lives. So the medication cannot be generally effective. In addition, the treatment has to continue from one generation to another, because of the large amount of frogs.

Thridly, she pointed out that it was global warming, rather than the excessive usage of water, cause the decrease of frogs' number. The global warming has already brought about the extincion of many species.
