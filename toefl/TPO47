There is a debate on whether the pterosaurs are capable of powered flight. The passage has made three arguments against powered flight.

The passage claims that pterosaurs have a slow metabolism and cannot produce enough energy to fly. The lecturer argues that fossils of pterosaurs indicates, that the dense metabolism of pterosaurs was more like wrm-blooded animals. So they were capable of generating sufficient energy to fly.

Second, the passage claims that pterosaurs were too heavy to flap their wings. However, the lecturer points out that they are light despite of their large size. Their bones had holes and their weight was low enough to flap wings fast and stay aloft.

Third, the passage indicates the back leg muscles of pterosaurs were tiny and not strong so they could not launch themselves into the air. But the lectuer argues that they in fact have 4 legs while birds have at most 2 legs. In addition, they can use all the 4 legs to push grounds, not only the 2 back legs. So they can run swiftly enough or jump aloft enough.
